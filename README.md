# Template angular 0.0.1

This is a simple template to use angular with material

## Adding Materials

Add the materials in the materials folder in each module.

## Testing

You can also look a the testing here as a template. The testing only covers the general parts of the app, adding for example a new angular material component, (in a any way different to the mentioned before), will break the testing. For more info take a look at <https://angular.io/guide/testing-components-scenarios>

## Only One Settings File

It uses only 1 settings file for all environments. For more info about this take a look at: <https://github.com/usil/nodeboot-spa-server>
